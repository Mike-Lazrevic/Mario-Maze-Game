INTRUCTIONS:
when opening the program it will intruct you to enter a filename. You must download the text file named "InputData" by typing exactly: "InputData.txt"\

Next, the fun begins, the game will intruct you at the start and with each following input to move the character "M" with r,l,u,d or exit the game with x.

The program outputs a new matrix List with empty cells being "~", these are safe to go on. BUT the "O" are boxes that may contain a treasure (+1 point) or a bomb (-1 point). 
The goal is to reach the exit with a score of 1 or more. Your score is displayed after each move. 

The exit is the "="

Good luck!
